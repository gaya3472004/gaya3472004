### 💡 Proposed Idea:

- **Smart Wall Cooling System** (In Planning)  
 A future project aimed at developing an IoT-enabled cooling system for walls using an ESP32 microcontroller, temperature sensors, and circulating water pipes to regulate indoor temperature. This system is designed as an alternative to traditional air conditioning, helping to avoid potential health issues associated with prolonged AC use, such as dry air and respiratory problems. The goal is to provide an energy-efficient and eco-friendly solution to reduce indoor heat without compromising air quality. I'm excited to start working on this idea soon!


### 🌟 My MiniProjects:

- [**Memory Allocation Simulation**]  
  A Java program that simulates memory allocation strategies (First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit) using a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize how memory is managed in different scenarios.

- [**Smart Streetlight System**]  
  An IoT-based system that optimizes energy consumption by controlling streetlights based on motion detection and ambient light sensing.

- [**Data Analytic Tool**](https://github.com/your-username/data-analytic-tool)  
  A web-based tool that processes and visualizes data from different sources, using MapReduce and generating PDF reports with dynamic visualizations.
